# Starship Pure

## ![Starship Pure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charitarthchugh/starship-pure/main/images/starship-pure.png)

Why?

- Starship has native support for conda environments, Java versions, Docker containers, etc.
- Easiest to use cross-shell for consistency
- Possibly faster than the original Pure prompt (because of Rust)

1. Install [Starship](https://starship.rs) is you have not already.
